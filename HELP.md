# HELP

Collected user hints and interaction preferences:

- Double-clicking a left settings section header should toggle all sections open/closed together.
- All preview-header actions should have keyboard shortcuts and those shortcuts should be visible in rollovers/help.
- Shift-drag on preview paragraphs should duplicate the paragraph.
- Ctrl-drag on preview paragraphs should snap drop rows to nearest baseline.
- Dark mode should style UI panels/headers/sidebars/editor popup and the preview shell background.
- Font selectors should use grouped categories (`Sans-Serif`, `Serif`, `Poster`) across both Typo panel and popup editor.
- Preview header uses divider separators between Presets/Load, Export/Undo, and Fullscreen/Baselines.
