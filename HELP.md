# HELP

Collected user hints and interaction preferences:

- Double-clicking a left settings section header should toggle all sections open/closed together.
- All preview-header actions should have keyboard shortcuts and those shortcuts should be visible in rollovers/help.
- Shift-drag on preview paragraphs should duplicate the paragraph.
- Dark mode should style UI panels/headers/sidebars/editor popup; preview canvas/paper rendering remains separate.
- Font selectors should use grouped categories (`Sans-Serif`, `Serif`, `Poster`) across both Typo panel and popup editor.
